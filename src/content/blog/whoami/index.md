## hanzotaz

Hi, I am hanzotaz, a software engineer based in Malaysia. I have a degree in Computer Engineering of which I graduated on January 2023.

Although my work right now involves more on web development (VueJS, NuxtJS and Go),
I have always been interested in cyber security. It is the main reason I even decide to take my degree in
Computer Engineering in the first place.

So to learn more on cybersecurity I decided to participate in several CTF competitions,
of which most them I didn't produce any writeups (of which I regretted) because I didn't think I'm that good. This site would hopefully
encourage me to produce writeups and increase my cybersecurity knowledge.

## kh4r0nyx

The name kh4r0nyx, is a combination of 'Kharon' or 'Charon' the ferryman from Greek mythology and Unix.
As much as I want to say I have a brilliant connection between Charon and a CTF team but to be honest I just like the name and figures.

Throughout my CTF journey, I have mostly been a solo team. But lately I think it'd be a good idea to create a team to gather people
that are interested in this field not only to solve more challenges but also to share our knowledge on the field.
