# Background

corCTF 2024 was a CTF event organized by Crusader of Rust team and was held from Sat, July 27, 2024 00:00 â€” Mon, July 29, 00:00 UTC. There are a total of 28 challenges, with catrgories made up of reverse engineering, web, pwn, crypto and forensics.

I managed to solve 2 challenges in this ctf competition both of which are under the forensics category. Despite this, I still enjoy my time with this CTF and it introduce me to a lot of concept, techniques and aproahc I can take to solve challenges so it is still a fruitfull experience.

Looking forward to the next corCTF next year!
